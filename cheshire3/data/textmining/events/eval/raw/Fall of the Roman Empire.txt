Most chronologies place the end of the Western empire in 476, when Romulus
Augustus was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer. The empire
in the East—known today as the Byzantine Empire, but referred to in its time
as the "Roman Empire" or by various other names—ended in 1453 with the death
of Constantine XI and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks.
