The first Act of Supremacy was a piece of legislation that granted King Henry
VIII of England Royal Supremacy, which means that he was declared the supreme
head of the Church of England.

The 1534 Act is often taken to mark the beginning of the English Reformation
although it had been brewing for more than a century.
