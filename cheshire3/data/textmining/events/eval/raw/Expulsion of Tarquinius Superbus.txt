The reign of Tarquin is typically described as a tyranny that justified the
abolition of the monarchy. His kingship ended in 509 BC, after his son Sextus
Tarquinius raped Lucretia, a married noblewoman known as an exemplar of
virtue. This outrage inspired an uprising led by the aristocrat Lucius Junius
Brutus, which resulted in the expulsion of Tarquin and his family from Rome.
