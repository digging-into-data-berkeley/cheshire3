A 1971 paper in the Journal of Molecular Biology by Kleppe and co-workers
first described a method using an enzymatic assay to replicate a short DNA
template with primers in vitro. However, this early manifestation of the basic
PCR principle did not receive much attention, and the invention of the
polymerase chain reaction in 1983 is generally credited to Kary Mullis.
