 The Cambridge University undergraduate newspaper ran its own short article
 on the discovery of the structure of DNA on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Bragg's
 original announcement at a Solvay conference on proteins in Belgium on 8
 April 1953 went unreported by the press. In 1962 Watson, Crick, and
 Maurice Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine
 for their determination of the structure of DNA.
