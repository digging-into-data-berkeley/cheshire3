The Conflict of the Orders, also referred to as the Struggle of the Orders,
was a political struggle between the Plebeians (commoners) and Patricians
(aristocrats) of the ancient Roman Republic lasting from 494 BC to 287 BC, in
which the Plebeians sought political equality with the Patricians.

The conflict began while Rome was at war with two neighboring tribes and all
the Plebeians left the city (the first secessio plebis). The result of this
first secession of the Plebs was the creation of the office of Plebeian
Tribune, and with it the first acquisition of real power by the Plebeians.
