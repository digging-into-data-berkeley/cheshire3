This first available rough draft assembly of the human genome was completed by
the Genome Bioinformatics Group at the University of California, Santa Cruz,
primarily led by then graduate student Jim Kent. Ongoing sequencing led to
the announcement of the essentially complete genome in April 2003, 2 years
earlier than planned. In May 2006, another milestone was passed on the way to
completion of the project, when the sequence of the last chromosome was
published in the journal Nature.
