The Wall Street Crash of 1929, also known as the Great Crash and the Stock
Market Crash of 1929, began in late October 1929 and was the most devastating
stock market crash in the history of the United States when taking into
consideration the full extent and duration of its fallout. The crash signaled
the beginning of the 10-year Great Depression that affected all Western
industrialized countries and did not end in the United States until the onset
of American mobilization for World War II at the end of 1941.
