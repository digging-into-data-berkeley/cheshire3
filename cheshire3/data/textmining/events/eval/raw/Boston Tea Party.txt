The Boston Tea Party (referred to in its time simply as "the destruction of
the tea" or by other informal names and not celebrated until half a century
later,) was a political protest by the Sons of Liberty in Boston, a city in
the British colony of Massachusetts, against the tax policy of the British
government and the East India Company that controlled all the tea imported
into the colonies.
