The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the Restoration of the
monarchy with Charles II in 1660.

On 4 April 1660, in the Declaration of Breda, Charles II made known the
conditions of his acceptance of the Crown of England. Monck organised the
Convention Parliament, which met for the first time on 25 April 1660. On 8 May
1660, it declared that King Charles II had reigned as the lawful monarch since
the execution of Charles I in January 1649.
