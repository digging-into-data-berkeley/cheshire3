After the formation of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in
1787, William Wilberforce led the cause of abolition through the parliamentary
campaign. It finally abolished the slave trade in the British Empire with the
Slave Trade Act 1807. He continued to campaign for the abolition of slavery in
the British Empire, which he lived to see in the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.
