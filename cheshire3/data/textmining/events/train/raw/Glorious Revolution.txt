The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow
of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland and James II of Ireland) by
a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of
Orange-Nassau (William of Orange). William's successful invasion of England
with a Dutch fleet and army led to William's ascending of the English throne
as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England.
