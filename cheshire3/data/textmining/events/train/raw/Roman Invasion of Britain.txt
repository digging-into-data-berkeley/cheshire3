Claudius also proceeded with the conquest and colonisation of Britain (in 43),
and incorporated more Eastern provinces into the empire.

After preliminary low-scale invasions of Britain, the Romans invaded Britain
in force in 43 AD, forcing their way inland through several battles against
British tribes, including the Battle of the Medway, the Battle of the Thames,
the Battle of Caer Caradoc and the Battle of Mona.
