The discovery of penicillin is attributed to Scottish scientist and Nobel
laureate Alexander Fleming in 1928. He showed that, if Penicillium rubens
were grown in the appropriate substrate, it would exude a substance with
antibiotic properties, which he dubbed penicillin. This serendipitous
observation began the modern era of antibiotic discovery.
